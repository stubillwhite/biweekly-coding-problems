# Rhyming Dictionary #

This week we're doing a fun exercise from Programming Praxis:

[Rhyming Dictionary](https://programmingpraxis.com/2012/04/24/rhyming-dictionary/)

If you'd like to take it a little further, you could generate nonsense limericks using the rhyming
dictionary. You'll need some way of picking words to satisfy the syllable count for the format,
which is described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_(poetry)).
