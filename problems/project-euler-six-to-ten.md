# Project Euler Six to Ten

Since we enjoyed it so much this week, next week we're going to try a few more problems from Project Euler.

For this week, let's look at problems six to ten inclusive. If you're short of time then just pick a fun one or two and
have a go at them. Looks like there are a few prime-related questions in there, so there'll be some reuse of this week's
work...
