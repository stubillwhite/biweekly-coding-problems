# Project Euler One to Five #

This week we're going to try a few small problems from Project Euler.

These are good bite-sized exercises for pure functional programming. For this week, let's tackle problems one to five
inclusive. If you're short of time then just pick a fun one or two and have a go at it. Ideally we'd like clean,
functional, immutable code, but whatever gets the job done is fine.
