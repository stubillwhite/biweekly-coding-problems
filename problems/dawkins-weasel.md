# Dawkins' Weasel

This week we're doing a fun challenge from Programming Praxis based around genetic programming.

[Programming Praxis - Dawkins' Weasel](https://programmingpraxis.com/2014/11/14/dawkins-weasel/)

It should be fairly easy to create a simple version that solves the exercise. If you want to make it a little harder,
you might want to abstract out the framework so that other experiments could be run using it.
