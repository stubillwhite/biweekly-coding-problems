# Wordle #

Let's kick off the new year by implementing Wordle. If you haven't played it before, the game is online here:

The rules are simple:

- You are given six attempts to guess a random five-letter word
- After each guess you are told which of the letters you have already guessed
    - Are in the word and in the right place
    - Are in the word and in the wrong place
    - Aren't in the word

Let's code it up! Making it pretty will probably take a reasonable amount of work, so it's up to you how pretty you make
the display.

If you're looking for a word list then this seems like a good candidate:
