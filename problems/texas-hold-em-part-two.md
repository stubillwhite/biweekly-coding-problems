# Texas Hold 'em - part two #

This doesn't really require the previous week's work, but if you've got it then you can just slot it in there. This week
we're going to try to classify poker hands. Poker has the following types of hands:

- Royal flush: A-K-Q-J-10, all the same suit
- Straight flush: Five cards in a sequence, all in the same suit
- Four of a kind: All four cards of the same rank
- Full house: Three of a kind with a pair
- Flush: Any five cards of the same suit, but not in a sequence
- Straight: Five cards in a sequence, but not of the same suit
- Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank
- Two pair: Two different pairs
- Pair: Two cards of the same rank
- High Card: When you haven't made any of the hands above, the highest card wins

Hands higher in the list beat hands lower down. 

If hands have the same 'type' (e.g., a pair vs a pair) then draws are resolved as follows:

- If the hands are of different rank in the 'type' of the hand then the higher ranked hand wins. For example,
  10-10-4-6-9 beats 9-9-4-6-8: a pair of tens beats a pair of nines, and the other cards (4-6-9 vs 4-6-8) are irrelevant
  because they aren't part of the pair. As another example, 10-9-8-7-6 beats 9-8-7-6-5: a straight where the high card
  is a ten is higher than a straight where the high card is a nine.

- If the hands have equal rank in the 'type' (for example, if both hands have a pair of twos) then the cards which do
  not take part in determining the 'type' of the hand (called kickers) are checked. The hand with the highest kicker
  wins, and if they are equal then the next highest kickers are compared. If the next highest kickers are equal then the
  next are compared, and so on. For example, 10-10-4-6-8 beats 10-10-3-6-8: both have a pair of tens, but the former has
  8-6-4 kickers which are higher ranked than 8-6-3 kickers.

There's a good summary on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands) if you need more details and
examples.

Write a function that takes two hands of five cards and tells you which hand is better. If you can handle draws and
kickers then that's even better.
