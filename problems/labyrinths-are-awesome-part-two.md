# Labyrinths Are Awesome - part two #

Last week we created a labyrinth. This week we're trying to escape it.

Given a labyrinth, a randomly selected start position, and a randomly selected end position, write an algorithm to
escape the maze. Your algorithm should be able to escape the labyrinths we created last week. You might also want to
experiment with how it behaves in labyrinths which are inescapable, or which contain loops, or wide open spaces.
